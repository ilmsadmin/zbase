Our application uses Facebook data exclusively for legitimate business management purposes:

1. Customer Communication: We help businesses respond to customer messages efficiently by centralizing Facebook messages with other communication channels.

```

#### Detailed permissions explanation

**pages_messaging**:
```
We need this permission to help businesses manage customer service inquiries from their Facebook pages. Our platform centralizes messages from multiple channels (Facebook, email, phone) into one dashboard, enabling faster response times and better customer service.

The business benefit is significant: instead of checking multiple platforms separately, business owners can handle all customer communication from one place. This is especially valuable for small businesses with limited staff.

We do not send automated messages. All responses are manually composed by business staff through our interface.
```

**pages_read_engagement**:
```
This permission allows us to help businesses monitor customer feedback on their posts. Our platform shows comments and engagement metrics in the business dashboard, enabling owners to:
- Respond quickly to customer concerns
- Track customer sentiment
- Identify trending topics or issues
- Generate engagement reports for business analysis

We only access public engagement data on the business's own pages. No private user information is collected or stored.
```

**pages_manage_metadata**:
```
We use this permission to keep business page information synchronized for accurate reporting. Our platform generates comprehensive business reports that include social media metrics alongside other business data (sales, inventory, etc.).

Accurate page metadata (follower count, page name, etc.) is essential for meaningful analytics. This helps businesses understand their overall performance across all channels.

We do not modify page settings - this is read-only access for reporting purposes only.
```

# Redis Implementation Summary for POS System

## Completed Tasks

1. **JWT Session Storage Configuration**
   - Created `PosCacheService` with JWT management methods
   - Implemented `JwtRedisStrategy` for Redis-backed authentication
   - Added `JwtRedisAuthGuard` for route protection 
   - Updated `AuthService` to store tokens in Redis with TTL

2. **Product Caching System**
   - Implemented methods for caching individual products
   - Added warehouse-based product list caching
   - Created pattern-based key invalidation for product updates
   - Set appropriate TTLs for efficient cache management

3. **Category Caching**
   - Implemented methods for caching individual categories
   - Added complete category list caching
   - Created cascade invalidation patterns for category updates
   - Set longer TTLs for relatively static category data

4. **TTL and Cache Invalidation Mechanisms**
   - Implemented default TTLs for different entity types
   - Created specific invalidation patterns for CRUD operations
   - Added comprehensive invalidation for related entities
   - Implemented `keys` pattern searching for efficient invalidation

## Next Implementation Steps

1. **Warehouse Module**
   - Create controller/service with Redis integration for warehouse data
   - Implement warehouse-specific caching strategies

2. **Product Module**
   - Create controller/service with full Redis cache integration
   - Implement search functionality with cache support
   - Add cache warming strategies for frequently accessed products

3. **Additional Redis Features to Consider**
   - Redis Pub/Sub for real-time inventory updates
   - Redis Sorted Sets for best-selling products
   - Redis Hash structures for more efficient storage

## Integration with Existing Code

- The Redis implementation has been integrated with the existing authentication system
- The `PosCacheService` is now available throughout the application
- JWT token storage in Redis has been successfully implemented
- Fixed dependency issues with MongoDB and PermissionsService
- Next modules will use the cache service for improved performance

## Documentation

- Created comprehensive Redis implementation documentation
- Updated POS-todo.md to reflect completed Redis tasks
- Added example usage patterns for future developers
